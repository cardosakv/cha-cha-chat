Cha-Cha-Chat is a web application made for everyone to chill and chat. While there are many chat applications available, this app is designed as a learning experience to demonstrate the functionality of real-time messaging platforms by allowing users to communicate through text and media. The goal is to explore web app patterns such as form handling, state management, database integration, real-time updates via WebSockets and cloud deployment.
